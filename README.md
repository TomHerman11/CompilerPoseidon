# CompilerPoseidon
An implementation of a compiler. Main exercise of "Compilation" course at Tel Aviv University.
"Poseidon" is an object oriented language, that was invented by the course staff.
This compiler was implemented by three other students and me.
Please read the EX1-EX4.pdf files for further details on "Poseidon" syntax, semantics and more.
Enjoy!
